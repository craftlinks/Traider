iBio, Inc. SAN DIEGO, Sept. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iBio, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBIO), an AI-driven innovator of precision antibody therapies, today announced its financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, and provided a corporate update on its progress. “This fiscal year has been transformative for iBio as we advanced both our pipeline and corporate strategy,” said Martin Brenner, Ph.D., DVM, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer of iBio. “We began building a differentiated preclinical portfolio in cardiometabolic diseases and obesity, highlighted by IBIO-610, an activin E-targeting antibody with compelling preclinical data supporting high-quality fat loss with muscle preservation, and IBIO-600, our long-acting anti-myostatin antibody. In parallel, we unveiled an additional innovative program, a bispecific antibody against myostatin and activin A, further expanding our next-generation antibody pipeline. Under our collaboration with AstralBio, we discovered a novel amylin receptor antibody. On the corporate side, our successful transfer of the listing of our common stock to Nasdaq, strengthened balance sheet, and the addition of successful industry leaders to our Board and management team have positioned iBio for long-term growth. And we are grateful our science was recently recognized by life sciences investors who participated in our recently closed offering to help us advance our innovative technologies. We remain committed to delivering transformative therapies to patients while driving sustainable value for our shareholders.” Progress on Cardiometabolic and Obesity Pre-Clinical Pipeline: Identified all four targets under the original multi-target discovery collaboration entered with AstralBio, Inc. (“AstralBio”) in April 2024, focused on genetically validated pathways in obesity and cardiometabolic disease, and amended the collaboration agreement in April 2025 to add a fifth target. In-licensed IBIO-600 and IBIO-610 from AstralBio, securing full development and commercialization rights to two of the company’s most advanced assets. Progressed IBIO-600, iBio’s differentiated long-acting anti-myostatin antibody designed for subcutaneous administration, through a non-GLP non-human primate (NHP) pharmacokinetics (PK) study whose data demonstrated extended half-life and dose-dependent muscle growth. Achieved development candidate nomination of IBIO-610, an activin E-targeting antibody, based on strong preclinical data from a 4-week study in diet-induced obese mice demonstrating a 26% reduction in fat mass and no measurable loss of lean mass. These findings demonstrate the potential of IBIO-610 for fat-selective weight loss. iBio initiated an NHP study for IBIO-610 to evaluate pharmacokinetics and early signs of efficacy in obese and elderly NHPs, including its impact on fat and body composition. Initiated a program leveraging iBio’s Machine-Learning Antibody Engine to develop a bispecific antibody targeting myostatin and activin A, and aimed at weight loss promotion, muscle preservation, and weight regain prevention. As part of iBio’s collaboration with AstralBio, it unveiled and demonstrated in vivo proof-of-concept for an amylin receptor antibody program with potential to deliver quality weight loss, favorable gastrointestinal tolerability, and lean mass preservation. Studies in a mouse model of obesity demonstrated reduced acute food intake by 60% (p<0.05), comparable to the reduction in food intake from a clinically advanced dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist (DACRA) peptide (67%). Corporate Developments: Began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol “IBIO,” marking a significant corporate milestone and enhancing visibility, improving trading liquidity, and aligning with the company’s strategy to attract long-term institutional investors. Raised $6.2 million in gross proceeds through a warrant inducement transaction with institutional investors, strengthening the company’s balance sheet and providing additional working capital to support advancements in its pipeline. Recently completed a $50 million underwritten public offering of pre-funded warrants and common warrants, with potential for an additional $50 million in gross proceeds upon full exercise of the common warrants, for total potential gross proceeds of up to $100 million. Expanded the Board with biotech industry veterans, David Arkowitz and António Parada, who bring deep sector experience and proven leadership in capital markets and antibody discovery and development. Bolstered the executive team with the hiring of Kristi Sarno, Senior Vice President of Business Development, to lead partnering efforts, drive pipeline growth, and accelerate external innovation. “In fiscal year 2025, we combined disciplined expense management with valuable funding initiatives to advance research and development of our obesity and cardiometabolic disease pipeline,” said Felipe Duran, Chief Financial Officer of iBio. “We secured non-dilutive funding through collaboration revenue and a warrant inducement transaction, allowing us to enter fiscal year 2026 well-positioned to execute on our growth strategy and support development of our clinical drug candidates IBIO-600 and IBIO-610.” Financial Results: Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, were approximately $0.4 million, an increase of $0.2 million over fiscal year 2024. Research and Development (“R&D”) expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024, were $8.3 million and $5.2 million, respectively, an increase of approximately $3.1 million. The increase in R&D expenses is mainly due to increased spending on consultants and outside services, and consumable supplies as a result of advancing research activities to support the company's IBIO-600, IBIO-610 and other preclinical pipeline assets. General and Administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024, were approximately $10.7 million and $11.7 million, respectively, a decrease of $1.0 million. The decrease is mainly attributable to a reduction in personnel-related costs, lower insurance premiums due to negotiated rates, and a decrease in depreciation, partially a reduction in legal fees, offset by increased franchise taxes and travel expenses. iBio held cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $8.8 million as of June 30, 2025.
